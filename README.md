# Try Vegetarian

This project was built for people who would like to try a vegetarian diet but aren't sure where to start or how to ensure they're getting enough nutritional value from their meals.

The user can fill out the form selecting minimum amount of calories, the meal type as well as the dish type. The program fetches the most appropriate recipe, displaying the amount of calories as well as nutritional value (proteins, fat, and carbs in grams).

Built with **ReactJS** and **styled-components**.
